# hello-world
this is my hello-world repository
This is where I say hello and remember that I have nothing to say, really. Writers block isn't about not being able to write, it's about not knowing what to write. When you stare at your kid and smile, when your dog is asleep by the fireplace and you're just sipping on tea is when you realize you're no longer the starving artist wanting to tell everyone all the things you've learned in your short yet enlightening time in college and high school. Maybe you were only starving for experience, though, and not for food or a good heater in your apartment.
